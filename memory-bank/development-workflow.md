# TSCMF Management Platform - Development Workflow and Next Steps

## Current Development Workflow

### Local Development Environment

1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository
   - Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services
   - Access frontend at http://localhost:3000
   - Access backend API at http://localhost:5000
   - Access API documentation at http://localhost:5000/docs
   - Access database admin at http://localhost:5050

2. **Development Process**:
   - Frontend and backend have hot-reloading enabled
   - Changes to React components update immediately
   - Changes to FastAPI server restart automatically
   - Database is persisted in Docker volumes

3. **Database Management**:
   - Initial schema creation using SQLAlchemy models
   - Migrations managed with Alembic
   - Sample data populated via CSV files
   - Database administration via pgAdmin

## Database Setup and Migration

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Database connection configured in `backend/src/database/database.py`
   - Models defined in `backend/src/models/models.py`

2. **Database Migration**:
   - Migration files in `/backend/migrations/`
   - Creation using `create_migration.py`
   - Database initialization with `init_db.py`
   - Database seeding via `populate_db.py`

## Potential Next Steps

### Backend Development

1. **API Expansion**:
   - Implement CRUD operations for entities, transactions, and events
   - Add filtering and pagination to API endpoints
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add validation for input data

2. **Service Integration**:
   - Implement the various services mentioned in the requirements:
     - Sanctions screening service
     - Eligibility check service
     - Limit management service
     - RDA booking engine
     - Exposure management service
     - Accounting service
     - Treasury service
     - Document management service

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add proper error handling and logging

### Frontend Development

1. **UI Enhancement**:
   - Complete implementation of all pages
   - Add form validation
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Enhance accessibility

2. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Add transaction creation flow
   - Implement user authentication UI
   - Add notification system
   - Implement real-time updates

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Enhance dashboard charts and metrics
   - Add export functionality for reports
   - Implement print-friendly views

### Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for backend services
   - Add unit tests for React components

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test API endpoints
   - Test frontend-backend integration

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Implement automated UI testing

### DevOps and Deployment

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up continuous integration
   - Implement automated testing
   - Configure deployment pipeline

2. **Production Environment**:
   - Configure production-ready Docker setup
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Implement backup strategy

3. **Security**:
   - Secure API endpoints
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add rate limiting
   - Configure HTTPS 

## Component Organization and Best Practices

Based on the recent Dashboard refactoring, the following best practices should be followed for frontend development:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Create small, focused components with single responsibilities
   - Organize related components in dedicated directories (e.g., `/components/dashboard/`)
   - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `ComponentName.js`)
   - Extract reusable UI elements into shared components

2. **Service Pattern**:
   - Separate data fetching and processing logic into dedicated service files
   - Place services in a `/services` directory
   - Each service should focus on a specific domain (e.g., `dashboardService.js`)
   - Services should handle API calls, data transformations, and business logic

3. **State Management**:
   - Keep state management simple and localized when possible
   - Use React hooks effectively (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
   - Avoid prop drilling by extracting components when necessary
   - Consider context API for more complex state requirements

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Use meaningful comments to document code sections
   - Group related functionality together
   - Follow consistent formatting and code style
   - Remove unused code and avoid commented-out code blocks

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implement proper loading states and error handling
   - Consider lazy loading for larger components

These practices help create a maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly codebase.
