   - `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Returns summary statistics for the dashboard

2. **Enhanced Data Processing:**
   - Added proper data formatting for API responses
   - Implemented relationship mapping between entities, transactions, and events
   - Added calculation of summary statistics (approved, processing, declined counts)
   - Implemented sorting of results (newest first)

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Dashboard Component:**
   - Changed `FORCE_MOCK_DATA` flag from `true` to `false`
   - Removed import of `MOCK_TRANSACTION_DATA`
   - Updated mock data to be self-contained for fallback purposes
   - Implemented API request handling with proper error handling

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Connected to multiple API endpoints in parallel using `Promise.all`
   - Implemented data transformation to map API data to component structure
