# TSCMF Management Platform - Implementation Summary

## Overview of Changes Made

We've updated the TSCMF Management Platform to replace mock data with real API data in the Dashboard component. This involved changes to both the backend and frontend code.

### Backend Changes

1. **Added Three New API Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/entities` - Returns all client entities
   - `GET /api/transactions` - Returns all transactions with related entity information 
   - `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Returns summary statistics for the dashboard

2. **Enhanced Data Processing:**
   - Added proper data formatting for API responses
   - Implemented relationship mapping between entities, transactions, and events
   - Added calculation of summary statistics (approved, processing, declined counts)
   - Implemented sorting of results (newest first)

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Dashboard Component:**
   - Changed `FORCE_MOCK_DATA` flag from `true` to `false`
   - Removed import of `MOCK_TRANSACTION_DATA`
   - Updated mock data to be self-contained for fallback purposes
   - Implemented API request handling with proper error handling

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Connected to multiple API endpoints in parallel using `Promise.all`
   - Implemented data transformation to map API data to component structure
   - Added relationship mapping between transactions and events
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

3. **Preserved UI Components:**
   - Maintained the same UI layout and design
   - Updated data sources while preserving component functionality
   - Maintained filtering, sorting, and visualization features

4. **UI Updates:**
   - Updated transaction table to display currency instead of goods
   - Removed the goods column from the table header and rows
   - Added a dedicated currency column for better financial data presentation
   - Modified the amount display to show numbers without currency symbols
   - Updated the transaction tooltip to display amount and currency as separate fields

## How It Works

1. **API Connection:**
   - The Dashboard component makes requests to the backend API
   - Data is fetched from three endpoints: stats, transactions, and events

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Transaction data is enriched with event information
   - Status and type information is derived from the latest event
   - Industry information is transformed into goods lists

3. **State Management:**
   - Component state is updated with real data from the API
   - Filtering and visualization functions work with the API data
   - UI components render based on the API data

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Data:**
   - Dashboard now shows actual data from the database
   - Changes in the database will be reflected on the dashboard

2. **Improved Architecture:**
   - Proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend
   - Single source of truth for application data
   - Consistent data format across the application

3. **Enhanced Scalability:**
   - System is now ready for additional data-driven features
   - Backend can be extended with new endpoints as needed
   - Frontend can consume additional API data with minimal changes

4. **Better Data Representation:**
   - More focused data presentation with currency information emphasized
   - Cleaner table layout showing only the most relevant transaction information
   - Improved financial data clarity for users
   - Separated amount and currency display for easier data interpretation and comparison
   - Consistent number formatting across the application

## Next Steps

   - Add pagination support for large datasets
   - Implement search and advanced filtering on the backend

2. **Add Authentication:**
   - Secure API endpoints with authentication
   - Implement user-specific data access

3. **Enhance Error Handling:**

These changes ensure a seamless transition to the new data model while maintaining the existing user experience and providing more accurate and detailed transaction information. 

## ADB Client Profile Tabbed Interface

The Transaction Detail page was updated to display different bank entities in a tabbed interface:

1. **Tab Structure**:
   - Implemented a 3-tab interface for displaying Requesting Bank, Issuing Bank, and Confirming Bank information
   - Added tab navigation with active state indicators
   - Each tab shows entity-specific data without transaction data

2. **Entity Data Display**:
   - Created a helper function `getEntityData()` to retrieve specific entity data based on the active tab
   - Sources entity data directly from the entity table fields:
     - Institution Name
     - Country
     - Address (from entity_address field)
     - Swift Code (from swift field)
     - Signing Office Branch (from signing_office_branch field)
     - Agreement Date (from agreement_date field)

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Added state management for active tab using `activeTab` state
   - Created tab switching functionality
   - Used conditional styling to highlight the active tab
   - Updated field labels to match the new data sources
   - Used appropriate icons for each data field (CalendarIcon for dates, IdentificationIcon for codes, etc.)
   - Maintained consistent UI styling with the rest of the application

This implementation provides a cleaner, more organized view of the different banks involved in the transaction, focusing specifically on entity data rather than mixing it with transaction data. 

## ADB Client Profile API Integration

The backend API and frontend components were updated to properly display entity data in the ADB Client Profile section:

1. **API Enhancements**:
   - Enhanced the `/api/transactions/{transaction_id}` endpoint to fetch entity data from the Entity table
   - Added explicit queries to retrieve issuing, confirming, and requesting bank entity information
   - Added the following entity fields to the API response:
     - `entity_address` - From the entity_address field
     - `swift` - SWIFT code for each bank
     - `signing_office_branch` - Office branch information
     - `agreement_date` - The date when agreements were signed

2. **Data Retrieval Flow**:
   - Transaction API now queries the related Entity records based on bank names
   - Entity data is properly formatted and included in the API response
   - Date fields are properly formatted as ISO strings
   - Added fallbacks to transaction data when entity-specific fields are not available

3. **Entity Relationship Handling**:
   - Improved entity relationship handling in the API to provide complete bank information
   - Updated the entities array with actual data from the Entity table
   - Ensured all bank entities (issuing, confirming, requesting) include their respective data

This implementation ensures that the ADB Client Profile section displays accurate entity data from the database instead of showing "Not specified" placeholders.
