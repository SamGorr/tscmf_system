    - Removed leading and trailing dashes
    - Normalized whitespace by replacing multiple spaces with a single space
    - Trimmed remaining whitespace from the beginning and end

- Benefits of standardized data cleansing:
  - Consistent display of instrument types across the application
  - Improved readability by removing irrelevant reference numbers and codes
  - Enhanced focus on the actual instrument type rather than reference details
  - Better data consistency between different sections of the Transaction Detail page
  - Simplified display that emphasizes the most important information
  - Unified user experience with standardized data presentation

### Industry Field Addition to Underlying Transactions Section (Added on 2023-12-01)

- Added 'Industry' field to the Underlying Transactions section of the Transaction Detail page:
  - Inserted the field right after the "Form of Eligible Instrument" field
  - Connected the field to the 'industry' column in the transaction table of the PostgreSQL database
  - Used TagIcon from Heroicons library for visual consistency
  - Added proper edit functionality to allow users to update the industry field
  - Maintained consistent styling with other fields in the section
  - Ensured the field is included in data fetching and saving operations
  - Data for the field is automatically populated from the transaction industry field in the database
  - The field properly shows "Not specified" when industry data is not available

- Benefits of this implementation:
  - Provides users with important industry classification information directly in the transaction overview
  - Improves data completeness in the user interface
  - Enhances transaction categorization and reporting capabilities
  - Maintains consistent UI/UX patterns with the rest of the application

### Industry Field API Fix (Added on 2023-12-02)

- Fixed an issue where the 'Industry' field in the Underlying Transactions section was not displaying data from the backend:
  - Identified that the transaction detail API endpoint was missing the industry field in its response
  - Modified the `/api/transactions/{transaction_id}` endpoint in main.py to include the industry field in the transaction_data dictionary
  - Ensured proper data flow from the PostgreSQL database to the frontend UI
  - Industry field now correctly displays the actual industry value stored in the transaction table

- This fix ensures:
  - Proper data completeness in the transaction detail view
  - Accurate industry classification display for all transactions
  - Consistent data flow between backend and frontend
  - Improved user experience by showing valuable transaction categorization information
  - Full functionality of the recently added Industry field UI component

### Fixed Entity Name Display in Trade Entity Information (Added on 2023-12-15)

- Fixed a critical issue in the Trade Entity Information section of the Transaction Detail page:
  - Identified that the entity name column was incorrectly displaying the entity type instead of the entity name
  - Root cause: In the backend `main.py` file, line 549 was incorrectly setting `"name": entity.type` in the entity_data dictionary
  - Modified the backend code to correctly use `"name": entity.name` to populate the entity name field
  - Fixed all entity rows in the Trade Entity Information table to display the correct entity name

- This fix ensures:
  - Proper display of entity names in the Transaction Detail page
  - Consistent entity information across the application
  - Accurate representation of transaction relationships
  - Improved user experience with correct entity identification
  - Better data integrity between the database and UI

### Renamed and Reorganized Entity Information Section (Added on 2023-12-20)

- Renamed the "Trade Entity Information" section to "Relevant Entity Information" for better clarity:
  - Updated the section heading to more accurately reflect its purpose
  - Improved navigation by using more descriptive terminology
  - Enhanced consistency with other sections of the UI

- Reorganized the entity information table:
  - Swapped the Name and Type columns to prioritize the entity name
  - Placed entity name as the first column to improve readability and scanning
  - Maintained the entity type as the second column for proper categorization
  - Kept other columns (Address, Country) in their original positions

- Benefits of these changes:
  - Improved user experience by prioritizing the most important information (entity name)
  - Better information hierarchy with primary identifiers first
  - Enhanced readability and scanning of entity information
  - More intuitive presentation of relationship data
  - Consistent with standard table design patterns that typically present identifiers first
