# TSCMF Management Platform - Implementation Summary

## Overview of Changes Made

We've updated the TSCMF Management Platform to replace mock data with real API data in the Dashboard component. This involved changes to both the backend and frontend code.

### Backend Changes

1. **Added Three New API Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/entities` - Returns all client entities
   - `GET /api/transactions` - Returns all transactions with related entity information 
   - `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Returns summary statistics for the dashboard

2. **Enhanced Data Processing:**
   - Added proper data formatting for API responses
   - Implemented relationship mapping between entities, transactions, and events
   - Added calculation of summary statistics (approved, processing, declined counts)
   - Implemented sorting of results (newest first)

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated Dashboard Component:**
   - Changed `FORCE_MOCK_DATA` flag from `true` to `false`
   - Removed import of `MOCK_TRANSACTION_DATA`
   - Updated mock data to be self-contained for fallback purposes
   - Implemented API request handling with proper error handling

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Connected to multiple API endpoints in parallel using `Promise.all`
   - Implemented data transformation to map API data to component structure
   - Added relationship mapping between transactions and events
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

3. **Preserved UI Components:**
   - Maintained the same UI layout and design
   - Updated data sources while preserving component functionality
   - Maintained filtering, sorting, and visualization features

4. **UI Updates:**
   - Updated transaction table to display currency instead of goods
   - Removed the goods column from the table header and rows
   - Added a dedicated currency column for better financial data presentation
   - Modified the amount display to show numbers without currency symbols
   - Updated the transaction tooltip to display amount and currency as separate fields

## How It Works

1. **API Connection:**
   - The Dashboard component makes requests to the backend API
   - Data is fetched from three endpoints: stats, transactions, and events

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Transaction data is enriched with event information
   - Status and type information is derived from the latest event
   - Industry information is transformed into goods lists

3. **State Management:**
   - Component state is updated with real data from the API
   - Filtering and visualization functions work with the API data
   - UI components render based on the API data

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Data:**
   - Dashboard now shows actual data from the database
   - Changes in the database will be reflected on the dashboard

2. **Improved Architecture:**
   - Proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend
   - Single source of truth for application data
   - Consistent data format across the application

3. **Enhanced Scalability:**
   - System is now ready for additional data-driven features
   - Backend can be extended with new endpoints as needed
   - Frontend can consume additional API data with minimal changes

4. **Better Data Representation:**
   - More focused data presentation with currency information emphasized
   - Cleaner table layout showing only the most relevant transaction information
   - Improved financial data clarity for users
